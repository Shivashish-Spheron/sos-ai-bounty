# 🚀 GPU Function as a Service Bounty

## 🌟 Overview

We're thrilled to announce a bounty of up to **$5,000** for creating an innovative GPU Function as a Service app! This platform will allow users to input Python functions and execute them on a schedule, leveraging GPU capabilities for efficient processing.

## 🎯 Objective

Develop a GPU Function as a Service app that can:

1. 📥 Accept Python functions as input
2. ⏰ Invoke functions based on scheduled triggers (e.g., cron jobs or custom schedules)
3. 🖥️ Utilize GPU capabilities for efficient function execution

## 📋 Requirements

### 1. Function Input

- 🐍 Allow users to input Python functions
- 📝 Provide an interface for uploading or writing functions directly within the app

### 2. Scheduling

- 🗓️ Implement flexible scheduling features (e.g., cron jobs, custom schedules)
- ⚙️ Ensure easy configuration of function triggers

### 3. GPU Execution

- 🎛️ Leverage GPU capabilities for efficient function execution
- 🔌 Support GPU-accelerated libraries and frameworks

### 4. User Interface

- 💻 Design an intuitive UI for function input, schedule setting, and execution management
- 📱 Ensure responsiveness across web and mobile platforms

### 5. Technology Stack

- 🔧 Backend: Any preferred language with GPU support (e.g., Python, Go, Node.js)
- 🖥️ Frontend: Web application or mobile app
- 🛠️ Utilize open-source tools and libraries for development

### 6. Documentation

- 📚 Provide comprehensive setup, configuration, and usage instructions
- 📝 Include guidelines for extending the app with additional features

### 7. Testing

- 🧪 Conduct robust testing for various edge cases
- ✅ Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests
