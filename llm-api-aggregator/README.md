# 🌐 LLM API Aggregator Bounty

## 🌟 Overview

We're thrilled to announce a bounty of up to **$4,000** for creating an innovative LLM API Aggregator! This platform will provide a unified API compatible with OpenAI's API for inferencing various large language models (LLMs) through a single endpoint.

## 🎯 Objective

Develop an LLM API Aggregator that can:

1. 🔗 Aggregate multiple open source large language models (LLMs)
2. 🔌 Provide a single, unified API compatible with OpenAI's API standards
3. 🚀 Simplify access and utilization of various LLMs through one API endpoint

- 🔗 Provide a unified API endpoint for seamless model access

### 2. OpenAI API Compatibility

- 🔄 Ensure compatibility with OpenAI's API standards
- 📡 Support similar endpoints, request formats, and response formats

### 3. Model Management

- 🔀 Implement features to manage and switch between different LLMs
- 🎛️ Allow users to specify which model to use for inferencing

### 4. User Interface

- 💻 Design an intuitive UI for API key management, settings configuration, and usage monitoring
- 📚 Provide comprehensive documentation and examples for easy onboarding

### 5. Technology Stack

- 🐍 Backend: Python
- 🏗️ Ensure API scalability to handle large request volumes
- 🛠️ Utilize open-source tools and libraries for the aggregation process

### 6. Documentation

- 📘 Provide comprehensive setup, configuration, and usage instructions
